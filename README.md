# About the NestShield suite
- NestShield was a group student project written for the Software Engineering 1 course at Florida State University.  
- This project also includes an Android application and a Windows service which both monitor the activity and processes on the device where the app is installed.
- The Windows version of NestShield can be found here: https://github.com/bgriffy/NestShield-Windows-1
- The Android version of NestShield can be found here: https://github.com/bgriffy/NestShield-Android
- ***NOTE: These repositories are forked from my other group members. I didn't contribute to the Android or Windows applications for NestShield. 
- This repo contains the web application version which I was solely responsible for developing.  
- The web portal is the main point of entry where parents can utilize the NestShield software suite.
- NestShield utilizes Firebase for its back-end. 

# About this web portal
- The web portal is where parents can view their child's activity and restrict access to sepcific apps.
- From the web portal, parents can create profiles for each of their children.
- For each child, parents can also create individual device profiles.

# How to run
- This portal is not currently hosted on the web.
- To demo the website, simply navigate to the src directory and run  ```node app.js``` from the command line.
- ***NOTE: When running the web application by itself, you won't be able interact with the device monitoring features. This is because in order to add a child/device to your profile, you must either install the Windows or Android version of NestShield so that the device to be monitor can be identified. But if you wish to demo these features, please let me know and I'd be more than happy to seed some data into the DB under your user account so you can mess with it.
