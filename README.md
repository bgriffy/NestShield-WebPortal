# About the NestShield suite
- NestShield was a group student project written for the Software Engineering 1 course at Florida State University.  
- This project also includes an Android application and a Windows service which both monitor the activity and processes on the device where the app is installed.
- The Windows version of NestShield can be found here: https://github.com/zilonkaj/NestShield-Windows
- The Android version of NestShield can be found here: https://github.com/Impinity/NestShield
- This repo contains the web application version which I was solely responsible for developing.  
- The web portal is the main point of entry where parents can utilize the NestShield software suite.
